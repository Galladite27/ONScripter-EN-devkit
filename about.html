        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Naoki Takahashi's NScripter is a popular Japanese game engine used
            for both commercial and free visual novels.  It attained popularity
            due to its liberal terms of use and relative simplicity.  However, it
            is closed source software and only available for Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
            A number of cross-platform clones exist, and Ogapee's ONScripter is
            the most popular of these.  Due to the ease with which it can be
            modified to support languages other than Japanese, ONScripter has been
            adopted by the visual novel localisation community as the engine of
            choice for translated NScripter games; the patch to support English
            even made it into the main ONScripter source code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the needs of the English visual novel translation
            frequently differ from Japanese ONScripter users, so we are maintaining
            our own branch of the ONScripter code to allow us to focus on the
            features that are most relevant to playing translated NScripter titles.
        </p>
