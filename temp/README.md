## About
This repository is not yet complete; expect significant change.
Oh, what change, you ask?
Here are some of the currently planned resources:

* A copy of the [updated command reference](https://github.com/insani-org/nscripter-api-doc)
* Copies of the tools included with ONScripter and ONScripter-EN for working with game filetypes (nsa, ns2, ns3, sar, dat, &c.) for Windows, Mac and Linux
* Tutorials based on (but far better than) the ONScripter-EN guide on my [website](https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/guide/guidepages/index.html), including a generic introduction to ONScripter-EN followed by both in-depth information for game developers as well as lighter-weight information for translators
* Potentially documentation containing more in-depth information about the working of onsen, including niche and undocumented features (of which I know a few, and I know ([@chaoskaiser72](https://github.com/chaoskaiser72) certainly knows some) as well as features and techniques not mentioned in any documentation such as [@chaoskaiser](https://github.com/chaoskaiser72)'s [list of ons.cfg options](https://kaisernet.org/onscripter/#onscripter-en)
* *Potentially* the as-of-yet untranslated [NScrLUA API reference](http://senzogawa.s90.xrea.com/reference/NScrLuaAPI.html) from Senzogawa
* Contact details and any other little pieces of information relevant to game developers and translators specifically, that ordinary users wouldn't need to know
