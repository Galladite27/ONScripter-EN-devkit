            <h1>ONScripter-EN full guide: 0 - further introduction</h1></p>

            <p>Welcome!</p>
            <p>Before you begin reading, know that while this guide is not <i>intended</i> for complete beginners, it is <i>possible</i> to read this rather than the quick-start guide if you really want to. While all the fundamentals of using the engine will be covered, just like in both of the quick-start guides, there will be a lot more theory and discussion, and a slower pacing overall, more like a textbook than a Wikihow article - but if that's your thing, it will surely lead to a more detailed and nuanced understanding.</p>
            <p>That being said, even this is not a complete guide. For a full understanding of the engine, its capabilities, and how to exploit them, you will become very familiar with the API reference. In addition, you will certainly need experience, whether that is acquired by poking at or working with existing games, or by making your own.</p>
            <p>However, this devkit as a whole aims to provide you with those things you may need, namely (1) a structured guide, (2) good reference documentation, and (3) the materials required to use and experiment with the engine. All that's left is your will.</p>

            <h2>Comparison to similar engines</h2>
            <p>Hopefully, you will know by now from the general introduction that ONScripter-EN is descended from ONScripter, which is in turn based on NScripter. However, I will present here a brief comparison of ONScripter-EN to other engines in the same family, so that you will understand the niche it fulfils and how it excels above the rest, especially since 2023. You will see that, for non-Japanese-language projects (and even for many of those), ONScripter-EN is the clear choice. ONScripterYuri has some interesting features and selling points, and is the only real contender to ONScripter-EN for 99% of new projects.</p>

            <h2>Using the API reference</h2>
            <p>By the time you are done with this guide, you will be very familiar with the API reference (see the "resources" page). It is a reference manual for the scripting language (NScript) which NScripter and derivative games are written in. Observe:</p>

            <h2>Division of the guide</h2>
            <p>As you can tell from the contents page, this guide is higly structured. This is a good thing, not bad - it should make it easier to find relevant information and give you a clear idea of where you are in the guide.</p>
            <p>Before we begin, we will cover the internals and externals of the engine; those being (1) the associated game files in more detail than before, (2) the various types of save files and their locations, (2) external customisation and settings, before (4) an overview of the operation of the engine, (5) how to interface with it, and finally (6) the syntax of the NScript language, ready to cover its usage in later articles.</p>
            <p>Then firstly, we will briefly touch on images and backgrounds, allowing us to conver basic usage of commands in-context and produce visible output, allowing us to discuss (and test with immediately visible results) more of the backend code.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we will discuss labels, variables, and conditionals, allowing us to manipulated stored data values and the flow of the interpretation of scripts, introducing fundamental structures such as subroutines and loops.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we will use this new solid understanding of the interpretation of scripts to begin introducing useful features properly, beginning with text display, the most fundamental feature of a novel game to the user, going into detail on text-display-related features and their correct and effective usage.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we will cover choices and buttons in their various forms, allowing for the implementation of user interaction besides simply advancing text.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, we will cover audio including BGM, SFX, and voicelines, comparing the commands and uses for the different audio formats, including coverage of legacy formats.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, we will cover more meta-gameplay concepts, namely menus and engine modes.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, we will touch on other noteworthy and modern (post-2023) features: alternative text display modes, video playback, custom &amp; variable screen resolutions, UTF-8 and proportional fonts.
            <p>Eighthly and finally, we will discuss the post-production topics of archive formats, compression, packanging and ditributing games.</p>
