= Galladite's ONScripter-EN guide, part 13: control flow =
This section will cover a little more on managing the flow of a program and making decisions.

== Notif ==
We've already covered the if command, but there is also a notif command, which works in an identical manner except the code is only executed if the statement is false. For example, the following will print "Not equal":

!mov %0,10
!mov %1,20
!if %0 == %1 "Equal"
!notif %0 == %1 "Not equal"

Of course you could just use the != condition but this is just another way.

== For loops ==
If you want to repeat a certain instruction several times, you can use the "for" command. It can count from one number to another, incrementing by a set number each time, running a piece of code over and over again until the second number is reached.
The piece of code to be repeated is terminated with the "next" command.
The for loop can also be terminated early using the "break" command.

$for %VAR=NUM to NUM[ step NUM]

For example, the following line will print even numbers from 0 to 10:

!for %0=0 to 12 step 10
!itoa $0,%0
!"$0"
!next

And the following will print just the number 1:

!for %0=1 to 10
!itoa $0,%0
!"$0"
!break
!next ;This line is never reached within the loop, but will be after the loop has been ended by the break command
