Hello and welcome to my guide to ONScripter-EN! This is structured so that anyone, even without any prior programming experience, should be able to create a visual novel. However, if anything needs clarifying, please do ask. Also, if I've got anything wrong, don't hesitate to correct me.

!Throughout this guide, code blocks will be formatted like this...

== History ==
For a history lesson on *NScripter, check out this page:

== Installing ==
To get set up, you need:
-A working build of ONScripter-EN for your OS
-A default.ttf file
-On windows, an SDL.dll file
All of these files should be placed in the same folder. Nothing else which may be included in builds such as licenses is needed.
For this set of tutorials, you might also want my testing assets folder (https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/bits-n-bobs/assets) if you don't want to find images yourself.

Builds of ONScripter-EN can be found here:
https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/resources/onscripter-en/builds/
These files should include SDL.dll and default.ttf
For windows, you shoud almost certainly choose the dsound version.

A common choice for default.ttf (which can be any truetype font you like) is sazanami gothic, a copy of which can be downloaded here if not included in the build:
