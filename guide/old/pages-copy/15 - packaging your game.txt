= Galladite's ONScripter-EN guide, part 14: date acquisition and screenshots  =
In this final stage of the tutorial, we will package our game's assets and script into archives so that they cannot be accidentally modified or viewed by users.
For this section, you will need a copy of the onscripter tools, available here: https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/resources/onscripter/tools%20%28builds%29/
Make sure that they are installed and you are in a command-line environment in the directory in which your game's files are stored.

== Preparations ==
To be able to use nsa archives, put the "nsa" command in your 0.txt just under the *define label like this:

!;mode800
!;gameid My Game
!*define
!nsa

== Packaging resources into arc.nsa ==
To create an arc.nsa file containing the game's resources, use the "nsamake" command in this format:

!nsamake arc.nsa -e folder1 folder2 folder3

All of the mentioned folders will now be packaged into one file, arc.nsa. Files will be accessed from arc.nsa as if the folders were where they are currently.

== Packaging the script into nscript.dat ==
To create an nscript.dat file containing the script (0.txt), use the "nscmake" command in this format:

!nscmake -o nscript.dat 0.txt

This will be read like the 0.txt file by ONScripter-EN, but it will be unreadable to the user.

== Testing ==
To test if the packaging has worked properly, try moving out the resource folders and 0.txt so that you are left with the ONScripter-EN executable, nscript.dat, arc.nsa and possibly SDL.dll.

== Making it multi-platform ==
To make your game multi-platform, include my multiplatform binaries folder (https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/guide/files/)

== Organisation and a README file ==
Have this versions folder, you game's folder and a README.txt file in the same directory (this isn't necessary but it looks nice).
To the README.txt, include a short description about your game, how to run it, how to copy in an executable for your system and any possible notes. For an example, see this: https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/guide/projects/calculator/calculator/

== Finishing up ==
Compress this one final folder into an archive of sime kind (.zip or .tar.gz are good) and give it a suitable name.
You should now have a professionally presented, multiplatform original english language visual novel (OELVN)!
