= Galladite's ONScripter-EN guide, part 14: date acquisition and screenshots  =
== Date and time acquisition ==
The date command will retrieve the current date in numeric values.

$date - program block only - retrieves the current date in numeric values
$date %VAR,%VAR,%VAR
$date year,month,date

The time command will retrieve the current time.

$time - program block only - retrieves the current time
$time %VAR,%VAR,%VAR
$time hour,minute,second

== Screenshot management ==
Screenshots can be taken and saved to memory with the "getscreenshot", "savescreenshot", and "deletescreenshot" commands.

$getscreenshot - program block only - collect a screenshot and save it to memory
$getscreenshot NUM,NUM
$getscreenshot width,height

$savescreenshot - program block only - save a screenshot from memory to a file as a bitmap (.bmp) image
$savescreenshot STR
$savescreenshot filename

$deletescreenshot - program block only - delete the screenshot currently saved in memory from memory
$deletescreenshot
$deletescreenshot

This process could be simplified with a custom command:

!;mode800
!*define
!defsub screenshot
!game
!*start
!click
!end
!*screenshot
!getscreenshot 800,600
!savescreenshot "screenshot.bmp"
!deletescreenshot
!return

The only issue with this is that it will overwrite the most recent screenshot each time, but this could be prevented with the use of a variable to count how many times screenshots have been taken.
