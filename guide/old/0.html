            <h1> Galladite's ONScripter-EN guide, part 0: introduction </h1></p>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my guide to ONScripter-EN! This is structured so that anyone, even without any prior programming experience, should be able to create a visual novel. However, if anything needs clarifying, please do ask. Also, if I've got anything wrong, don't hesitate to correct me.</p>
            
            <p class="code">Throughout this guide, code blocks will be formatted like this...</p>
            <p class="definition">... and command definitions will be formatted like this.</p>
            
            <h2>History</h2></p>
            <p>For a history lesson on *NScripter, check out this page:</p>
            <p>https://kaisernet.org/onscripter/</p>
            
            <h2>Installing</h2></p>
            <p>To get set up, you need:</p>
            <p>-A working build of ONScripter-EN for your OS</p>
            <p>-A default.ttf file</p>
            <p>-On windows, an SDL.dll file</p>
            <p>All of these files should be placed in the same folder. Nothing else which may be included in builds such as licenses is needed.</p>
            <p>For this set of tutorials, you might also want my testing assets folder (https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/bits-n-bobs/assets) if you don't want to find images yourself.</p>
            
            <p>Builds of ONScripter-EN can be found here:</p>
            <p>https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/resources/onscripter-en/builds/</p>
            <p>These files should include SDL.dll and default.ttf</p>
            <p>For windows, you shoud almost certainly choose the dsound version.</p>
            
            <p>A common choice for default.ttf (which can be any truetype font you like) is sazanami gothic, a copy of which can be downloaded here if not included in the build:</p>
            <p>https://galladite.net/~galladite/nscripter/resources/bits-n-bobs/sazanami-gothic.ttf</p>
