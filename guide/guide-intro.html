            <p>Hello and welcome to my guide to ONScripter-EN! This is structured so that anyone, even without any prior programming experience, should be able to create a visual novel. However, if anything needs clarifying, please do ask. Also, if I've got anything wrong, don't hesitate to correct me.</p>
